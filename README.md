# File-Transfer-Protocol-FTP-
FTP is a client-server protocol that relies on two communications channels between the client and server: a command channel for controlling the conversation and a data channel for transmitting file content.  Here is how a typical FTP transfer works:  A user typically needs to log on to the FTP server, although some servers make some or all of their content available without a login, a model known as anonymous FTP. The client initiates a conversation with the server when the user requests to download a file. Using FTP, a client can upload, download, delete, rename, move and copy files on a server.
